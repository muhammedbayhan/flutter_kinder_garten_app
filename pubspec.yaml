# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - .env
    - assets/svg/circle1.svg
    - assets/svg/maleStudentAvatar.svg
    - assets/svg/femaleStudentAvatar.svg
    - assets/svg/maleTeacherAvatar.svg
    - assets/svg/femaleTeacherAvatar.svg
    - assets/svg/teacherDefault.svg
    - assets/svg/
   
    - assets/images/mm.png
    - assets/images/
    #- assets/images/announcements.png
    #- assets/images/demo.png
  
    - assets/gifs/splash.gif
    #- assets/gifs/
    - assets/animations/animation_lo7sfwta.json
    - assets/animations/teacherSplash.json
    - assets/animations/
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Lexend
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Lexend-Black.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Lexend-Bold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Lexend-ExtraBold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Lexend-Medium.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Lexend-Regular.ttf
        
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
